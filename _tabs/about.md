I created this website to document my growth, organize knowledge, and fuel my ongoing passion for exploration. As a computer science student, I maintain a strong enthusiasm and curiosity for technology. From computer vision to cybersecurity, from front-end development to compiler theory, I enjoy learning across diverse fields, seeking to connect foundational principles with practical applications.

Although my interests are broad, I understand the importance of focus. Currently, I am concentrating my efforts on the field of cybersecurity, striving to build a solid foundation through systematic study and hands-on practice. This area not only challenges technical skills but also sharpens problem-solving and defensive thinking.
