# 4 kinds presentations of DataView
- List
- Calendar
- Task
- Table

# How to use?
```dataview
LIST
```
By using *LIST* keyword, we can generate a list of existing *.md* files.
## Filter: folders
Now we want to limit the items in the list.
```dataview
LIST
FROM "10-19 Computer Science/12 Computer Network"
```
Now this list only shows *.md* files in directory "10-19 Computer Science/12 Computer Network".
For sub-folder, use "/" to split the address.
## Filter: tags
```dataview
LIST
FROM #project
```
For tags, we don't need the *""* symbol. We just add *\#tags* into FROM part.

**A useful skill is to add status of project into nest part. Like \#project/active, use "active" to mark the status of this project. And when we search \#project, the result will include \#project/active. In this sample of list, TF.DATA API is tagged by \#project/archive.**

## Filter: Mix
For example, we can use keyword *"AND"* or *"OR"* to combine different tags or folders. 

If we want some categories have high priority, we can use *parenthesis* like high school math.

# Limitation of DataView
We **can't** present the contents of our notes. We can only show the name into data view. We **can't** search contents too.

So what can Dataview search? The answer is **metadata**.

### How to use metadata in Dataview?
Use *WHERE file.xxx <>= xxx* to define the filter.
```dataview
LIST
WHERE file.ctime >= date(2024-01-01)
```
In this sample, we use `WHERE file.ctime >= date(2024-01-01)` to find which files are created after 2024-01-01. We can use *AND* to define a range of date.
```dataview
LIST
WHERE file.ctime >= date(2025-04-31) AND file.ctime <= date(2025-06-15)
```

More of this, we can use `mtime` which means modify time. Use minus *"-"* symbol to **exclude** some results. Here are the results for files which be modified last week. Use **`dur(x week/day)`** to present a duration time.
```dataview
LIST
WHERE file.mtime >= date(today) - dur(1 day)
```


## How to use metadata to find files?
*[Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/properties)* can be searched by Dataview. If we don't want to use properties and we just want to add a temp mark into notes. We can use this format to add a mark:
	`keywords::value`

The syntax of this filter is: `WHERE keywords/property = "value"`
Here is an example using `WHERE status = "archive"`
```dataview
LIST
WHERE status="archive"
```

# Sort and Limit length of your results and MORE
## Sort
```dataview
LIST
WHERE file.mtime <= date(yesterday) - dur(1 day)
SORT file.name ASC
```
 We can sort results based on any fields like `file.name` or `file.mtime`. 2 sort methods can be used: `ASC` or `DSEC`.
## Limit Length
 
It looks too many items in this list. We can use `LIMIT #Length` to limit the number of items.
```dataview
LIST
WHERE file.mtime <= date(today) - dur(1 day)
SORT ASC
LIMIT 5
```

## Table 
And we can use table view to present the created time:
```dataview
TABLE file.ctime AS "Created time"
WHERE file.mtime <= date(today) - dur(1 day)
SORT file.ctime ASC
LIMIT 6
```
## Show all links
We can show a list including all links to this file.
**Tips: Only shows links current don't link for now.
```dataview 
list from [[]] and !outgoing([[]])
```


## Split
`regexreplace(file.folder, "^.*\/", "") AS "Area"`
regexreplace(original string, regular expressions, replace to ?)
